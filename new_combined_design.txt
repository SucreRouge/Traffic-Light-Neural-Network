Simulation Software will runn two hundered timesteps and generate log output

the neural network will train on a dynamic number of testpoints 

the neural network will decide if the lights should be red or gren based on it's training from 1-200 points


a = TrafficSimulator()

a.set_traffic_pattern(????)

run simulation for 200 points

LSTM Classifier()

bring in logg data and train on it

looks at last 100 steps and determine next state
